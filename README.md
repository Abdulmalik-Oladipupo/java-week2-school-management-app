# School Management System (OOP Project)

## 📌 Project Description
This project models a basic school system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The system includes:

- Non-Academic Staff
- Students
- Applicants
- Courses
- ClassRoom

The Principal can admit applicants based on age and expel students.
Teachers can teach courses.

## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Used

- Encapsulation (private fields with getters/setters)
- Inheritance (Principal, Teacher, NonAcademicStaff extend Staff, while Student,Applicants extend Learner)
- Polymorphism (performDuty() method overridden)
- Abstraction (Staff class and Learner class iare abstract)
- Interfaces (StaffAction)
- Aggregation & Composition (Classroom contains Students, Staff, and Courses)
